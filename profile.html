        <h1>Skills</h1>
        <p>I have learned some skills while taking Devmountain Foundations. I'm still very new
            to all the concepts and languages.
            <ul>
               <li>I've learned how to use languages in vs code.</li> 
               <li> I've learned how to use git and github.</li>
                <li>I've learned some javaScript.</li>
                <li>I've learned that I don't want to be a web dev. Because I hate CSS.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>There are lots of things in life to be interested in. From basic skills to 
            things I like movies or tv shows. Interesting things is a really broad 
            topic that could involve telling my life story. But let's keep it simple.
            <ul>
                <li> always comes first. Because we will always be there for each other.</li>
               <li> Making sure basic needs are met roof over your head and food on the table.</li>
               <li> Enjoying time with one another in good times and in bad.</li>
               <li>Liking types of music, movies, disney.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="favoriteButton" button id="color">My Favorite Color</button></div>
            <div class="favoriteButton" button id="place">My Favorite Place</button></div>
           <div class="favoriteButton" button sid="ritual">My Favorite Ritual</button></div>
            
        </p>
        <h3>Career goals</h3>
        <p>Yeah I did focus on high school and community college corses. Those are just 
            part of the foundations of life. I didn't get my dream job right away and 
            in some ways I don't know if I will ever get there. 
            <ul>
               <li>In high shool I had big dreams of doing well.</li>
                <li>In community college expanded on things I had learned.</li>
               <li>But I didn't find a job I wanted even after searching.</li>
                <li>I ended up in retail and learned most positions well.</li>
               <li>Getting fed up with being treated poorly and doing remote learning with my daughters motivated me.</li>
               <li> I decided I could be an app developer. Why not try with who I'm today.</li>

            </ul>
